# Fire Emblem Practice Portfolio by HanYeong SHIN

This project is based on the Fire Emblem series by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, to whom all rights to Fire Emblem belong.

I’ve been a fan of the Fire Emblem series since my childhood, starting with the Game Boy era. (Though my first Game Boy title was actually "Advance Wars" by Intelligent Systems.) My journey with Fire Emblem continued on the 3DS, beginning with Fire Emblem Awakening, followed by the Fate series and Echoes, which marked the end of the Fire Emblem series on the 2DS/3DS.

Since then, I’ve enjoyed playing Fire Emblem: Three Houses on the Nintendo Switch, and more recently, Fire Emblem Engage.

As mentioned, this project is a practice portfolio and is not intended for commercial use.

Anyways, as mentioned above, this project is Fire Emblem Practice Portfolio by HanYeong SHIN
It is meant to be practice for myself, not for the selling purpose.

Used Tools are
- Visual Studio 2019 (for the "v142" compatibility on my workspace)
- Adobe Photoshop
- Sony Vegas
