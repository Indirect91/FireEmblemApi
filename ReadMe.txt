Fire Emblem Practice Portfolio by HanYeong SHIN.

Original game by Nintendo and Intelligent systems, where full possession of Fire emblem belongs to.
I remember playing Fire Emblem series from GameBoy era when I was young.
(Actually my first Gameboy title was "Advance wars" by intelligent systems)
Fire Emblem Awakening was my first title on 3DS, followed by Fate series and Echoes, 
which became the last Fire Emblem series of 2DS/3DS era.
Currently I am playing FE Heroes, waiting for new title from Switch.
I am quite excited about Fire Emblem Three Houses on Nintendo Switch, which is expected to be released in summer of this year.


Anyways, as mentioned above, this project is Fire Emblem Practice Portfolio by HanYeong SHIN
It is meant to be practice for myself, not for the selling purpose.
